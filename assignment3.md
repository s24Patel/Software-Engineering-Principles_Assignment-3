## Requirement 3: Secure System Access
**As a system administrator, I want to restrict access to training data so that only authorized users can modify it.**

### Assumptions & Validation
- **Assumption:** Unauthorized access to training data could lead to data corruption or security risks.
- **Validation:** Conduct security audits to ensure access controls function correctly.

### Preliminary Tasks
- Implement role-based authentication to control data access.
- Set up activity logging to track modifications and access attempts.
- Encrypt stored data to prevent unauthorized modifications.

### Actionable Tasks
- Develop user authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).
- Implement an access log system for tracking modifications.
- Encrypt stored and transmitted training data.
- Perform penetration testing and resolve vulnerabilities.

### Outcome
- Unauthorized users are prevented from altering training data, ensuring data integrity and security.

## Requirement 4: Dataset Export Functionality
**As a developer, I want to export categorized training data in multiple formats so that I can easily use it in AI training.**

### Assumptions & Validation
- **Assumption:** Developers need flexibility in exporting training data for various use cases.
- **Validation:** Conduct surveys with developers to determine preferred export formats.

### Preliminary Tasks
- Implement export functionality supporting JSON and CSV formats.
- Ensure exported data maintains categorization structure and accuracy.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for data export options.

### Actionable Tasks
- Design an export module supporting JSON, CSV, and XML.
- Implement a user interface for selecting export formats.
- Validate exported data integrity across multiple formats.
- Develop automated testing for export functionality.

### Outcome
- Developers can seamlessly export structured training data in preferred formats.
